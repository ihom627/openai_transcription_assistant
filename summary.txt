During Ford Motor Company's 3rd Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, executives discussed the company's financial performance, strategic initiatives, and future outlook. Jim Farley, President and CEO, highlighted the tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers and the focus on restarting assembly plants and supporting suppliers, emphasizing the challenges and excitement surrounding the evolution of the EV market and technology disruptions. Ford is progressing towards building a dynamic company that thrives on iconic vehicles, brands, software, and services, with a strategy dubbed Ford Plus aimed at industry transformation. The company reported mixed financial results, with strong product and revenue performance but impacts from strikes and ongoing cost and quality challenges. Leadership changes were announced to accelerate progress on these fronts. Ford Blue, Model E, and Ford Pro were identified as distinct growth businesses, with Ford Blue focusing on strong product lines and Model E on competitive EV development, emphasizing cost reduction, scaling, vertical integration, and battery efficiency. Ford Pro is positioned as a growth driver through its commercial vehicle offerings and software-driven services. Peter Stern, President of Ford Integrated Services, outlined the vision for transforming customer experiences through integrated services across Ford's segments, aiming to unlock value through connected, convenient, and secure offerings. Financially, Ford reported $9.4 billion in adjusted EBIT through the first three quarters but withdrew its full-year guidance due to uncertainties from the UAW strike. The company remains focused on disciplined capital allocation, maintaining strong liquidity, and adjusting EV production and investment in response to market demand.
